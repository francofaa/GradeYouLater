# GradeYouLater
I wanted to create a simple grading system, hopefully to inevitably turn it into an app.

## Goals
The user will be able to

- Set an assignment
- Ascribe a point value to that assignment
- Enter in a student's name
- Increment the student's score by 1 as the user goes through grading the assignment
- Decrement in case of error
- Render a percentage grade based on the score
- Push the score, assignment, and associate student to a list
- Export that list to CSV or another format for entering into a gradebook

## Origin

I was helping my girlfriend grade her students' worksheets for her French class. We went section by section, tallied up the points, and took the points and got the percentage right. She then entered that grade into a gradebook. 

I wanted to make a simple app that could tally the student's score one by one and figure out the percentage from the total, and after that I realized you could automate so much more. My next step is getting the thing to email you with a CSV spreadsheet file so that you could enter the grades in using whatever gradebook app you use.
